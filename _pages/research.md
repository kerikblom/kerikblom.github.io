## My research

Broadly, my research concerns the full pipeline of computational 
modeling of populations of biological cells - reducing aspects of the
biology into mathematical models, solving, sampling, simulating
these models, and drawing inference from data applying statistical
methods to the models. Specifically, I study simplest-possible
models of avascular tumour growth that reproduce known qualitative
behaviour of the real phenomena. 

Together with [Stefan
Engblom](https://user.it.uu.se/~steng957/){:target="_blank"}, I have
investigated both morphology

and malignancy [2](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.01305){:

such models.
