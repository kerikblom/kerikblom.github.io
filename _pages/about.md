I am a PhD student of computational science at Uppsala University, Sweden. Broadly, computational science (or scientific computing) is the branch of science that analyses problems using computational methods (solving mathematical problems beyond the practical capacity of pen and paper, or chalk and board), including analyses of the methods themselves. Ideas and hypotheses of science can be made precise by mathematics, and testable by computation.

In my work, I study biological problems, specifically the dynamics of cell populations emerging from interactions both in between the cells and between the cells and their environment. Through combinations of numerical methods, Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian methods, agent-based modelling and mathematical analysis, I am investigating tumour growth patterns, shape stability, and the onset of malignancy through mutation and selective pressure, among other things. What, we reflect on, do the simulations of our computational models reveal about the biological phenomena they intend to represent?
